2.0

- Fixed problems with the calculation of ESBL status and carbapenem resistance
- Completely rewrote the way resistances are calculated- now they read in
data from an external XML file

2.1

- Removed Phoenix warning
- Fixed a bug with the Vitek parser involving the date the sample was collected
- Tweaked the GUI's default size (note: test your GUIs in both tiling and non-tiling
WMs)

2.2

- Misc fixes
- Removed several parsers- MicroScan1 didn't work anyway, and MS2, dat, and spreadsheet
are now handled by the custom parser function
- Added a custom parser function- use RevealerParserWizard to generate them

2.21

- Fixed a bug with the Vitek parser

2.22

- Fixed another bug with the Vitek parser- the file format changed slightly
- Made the main window title display the version number

2.24

- Yet another Vitek hotfix- if the program would throw an IndexOutOfBounds error when adding MICs, it'll just skip them and move on to the next line

2.25
- Hotfix for the hotfix. Vitek changed their format AGAIN and I had to change the program to compensate.
